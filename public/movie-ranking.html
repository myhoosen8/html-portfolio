<h3>1. Tropic Thunder</h3>

<p>Consisting of one of the most highly-rated casts of all time, with actors such as Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr. and Ben Stiller, the comedic chaos that ensues will grip you from start to finish.</p>

<h3>2. Austin Powers</h3>

<p>Mike Myers is an absolute delight with his take on what a British Super Spy from the 80s looks like. Yeah baby!</p>

<h3>3. Ace Ventura</h3>

<p>We all know and love Jim Carrey! This was one of his most outstanding (and outlandish) roles to date. A true comedic genius of our era.</p>
