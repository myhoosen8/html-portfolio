<h1>About Mohammed Youshaa Hoosen</h1>
<h2>A Brief History...</h2>
<p>Hailing from the south of Joburg, my journey has almost certainly come full circle.</p>

<p>After graduating from high-school in 2010, I was left in the lurch—largely due to my own negligence—with no idea 
  as to how the next leg of my life would turn out.</p>

<p>I began my studies Information Technology in 2011, started working in Information Security in 2012, 
  resigned from my job at the end of 2014, started studying Sport Communication in 2014, 
  graduated top of my class in 2016, stumbled into a very prestigious graduate program at Ogilvy where I 
  learned the trade of Copywriting, blah blah blah and now I'm back... coding... programming.</p>
